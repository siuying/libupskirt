# This script is used for markdown validation:
# The original Markdown.pl expand tabs into spaces, which is something
# I don't want to do, and it cannot be easily fixed in the renderer,
# so has to be preprocessed. expand(1) is used for that preprocessing,
# feeding tab-free data into my markdown.

expand -t 4 "$@" | $(dirname $0)/markdown
